The Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS or DRS) is a technology-based system used in cricket to assist the match officials with their decision-making. On-field umpires may choose to consult with the third umpire (known as an Umpire Review), and players may request that the third umpire consider a decision of the on-field umpires (known as a Player Review).  The main elements that have been used are television replays, technology that tracks the path of the ball and predicts what it would have done, microphones to detect small sounds made as the ball hits bat or pad, and infra-red imaging to detect temperature changes as the ball hits the bat or pad. 

So this review system help us to watch the clip in fast forward slow forwad previous according to the choices of the user . To make it realistic background sounds are thre using the python module mixer . and we can see the video clip by clicking on the buttons provided there . if the third umpire have  decided the decided the decision the sponserd images will be shown for r(random seconds) just to make it more realistic and then after  the sponsers images decision will be shown


to enhance  this project we can  use ip cameras to connect it through our pc so that we can see the live clips and the clips keeps changing time to time . many more changes and enhancements can be done like lbw out ,not out,wide ball,no ball , six , four, run out .etc
